Code  for 'Phenotypic plasticity shapes the elevation range of Himalayan altitudinal migrants'

1) We used two species (Tarsiger chrysaeus and Tarsiger indicus) in our study.

2) Bush_robin_code.zip contains 4 R scripts for relevant analyses, including:

  R-script-for-DEG analysis.R
  R-script-for-WGCNA.R

  R-script-for-figure plot.R

The version of R software and how to install them can be found on each script. R version 4.2.0 was used to conduct all R analyses.
