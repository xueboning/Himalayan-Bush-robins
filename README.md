# Himalayan-Bush-robins
Code  for 'Phenotypic plasticity shapes the elevation range of Himalayan altitudinal migrants'

1) We used two species (Tarsiger chrysaeus and Tarsiger indicus) in our study.
2) We used four tissues (heart, flight muscle, lung and liver) in our study.
   
3) Bush_robin_supplementary_code.zip contains 3 R scripts for relevant analyses, including:

  R-script-for-DEG analysis_v1.r
  R-script-for-WGCNA_v1.r
  R-script-for-vector analysis_v1.r

The version of R software and how to install them can be found on each script. R version 4.2.0 was used to conduct all R analyses.
